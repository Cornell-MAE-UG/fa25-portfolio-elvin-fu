## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. As an undergraduate, I collaborated on a research project exploring the viability of extracting lithium from seawater for lithium-ion batteries with a graduate research student in Dr. Maha Haji’s Symbiotic Engineering and Analysis Lab. In particular, I have conducted life cycle assessments on various lithium-based battery chemistries, which utilize lithium sourced from mined ore and brines, using the software tools Ecoinvent in OpenLCA and GREET. These results will serve as a baseline of comparison for the environmental impacts of existing and seawater pathways in future work. Additionally, I have explored the viability of high-pressure pretreatment of seawater for water desalination and pumped-hydro energy storage system applications. Current pretreatment systems operate at low pressures, and increasing the pressure would enhance efficiency.

My dream is to work in the research and developement of novel and innovative energy storage technologies for sustainable energy and transportation applications. Research will enable us to explore all possible battery chemistries and identify potentially viable options. The development of these technologies will then allow us to test and assess their usability in real-life applications. In my view, many newer sustainable energy systems lack behind traditional fossil fuels and other harmful energy sources because they lack an effective way to store energy that is cost efficient. If we can solve this issue, then a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions can be eliminated. It could also have a trickle down effect to other technologies like buildings and transportation as both of those things rely upon electricity for power.
