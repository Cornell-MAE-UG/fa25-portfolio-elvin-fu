A wind turbine blade was designed to maximize power generation with the NACA 4412 cross section in a wind velocity profile given by the Weibull probability distribution, p(U) = (k/c)(U/c)^k-1exp[-(U/c)^k] where k = 5 and c = 5, where U is the incoming wind velocity m/s. The design had to meet constraints where the designed operating angular velocity is less than 2000 RPM, must be compatible with the standard hub piece, have a maximum length of 6 inches from root to tip, and a maximum width of 2 inches. Using a combination of an iterative method and a blade element theory, both in Matlab, an optimized blade was designed to operate at 1100 RPM and a wind speed of 4.167 m/s. Dimensions were generated at elements along the entire length of the blade of 6 inches using equations that don’t account for rotational wake and tip losses. 

Using a combination of an iterative method and a blade element theory, both in Matlab, an optimized blade was designed to operate at 1100 RPM and a wind speed of 4.167 m/s. Dimensions were generated at elements along the entire length of the blade of 6 inches using equations that don’t account for rotational wake and tip losses. Using these generated dimensions, a CAD file was created and a prototype was printed using Accura 25 material.

Power curves at different wind speeds near the design wind speed of 4.167 m/s were obtained through testing of the prototype of our design in a wind tunnel and plotted on the same graph. The prototype was able to sustain the loads during operation and did not exhibit failure. When obtaining this experimental data, our prototype exhibited an unexplained behavior where the wind turbine could not spin sustainably at a rotational velocity of around and below 1500 RPM. A double peak behavior was observed during the testing at some of the wind velocities, which may be attributed to the torque break hysteresis.

I focused on developing the blade element theory model in Matlab. This model was used to simulate the loads experienced by the blade during operation. We used it to make sure that the loads didn't exceed the max flexural strength of the Accura 25 material. When using this model, we used a safety factor of 100 in order to account for any potential errors in the model and to be very sure that our blades wouldn't fail.
